# DDP_ShinyApp
Developing Data Products Shiny App

Instructions of the course are as follows:

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

My Shiny Application

The Shiny application helps to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on two inputs: weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters) of an individual.  The output then is able to determine whether one is underweight, within normal range, overweight or severely overweight in the Singaporean context.  More background information can be found on the app itself at https://ntgjg.shinyapps.io/devdataproducts/.
